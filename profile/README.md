## 🏥 About Anamnetic

**Anamnetic** is a digital health assistant designed to bridge the gap between patients and their healthcare journeys. In a world where health data is fragmented across clinics, devices, and paper records, Anamnetic provides a centralized, secure, and intelligent platform for health management.

The solution acts as a personal health hub, tracking:
* **Medical Consultations:** History, notes, and professional advice.
* **Exams & Diagnostics:** Centralized storage for lab results and imaging.
* **Personal Metrics:** Real-time data integration from smartwatches (heart rate, sleep, steps) and digital scales (body composition).
* **Treatments:** Monitoring medication adherence and long-term health plans.

## 🚀 The Vision & Roadmap

Our goal is to transform passive data into actionable insights. The development roadmap includes:

- [ ] **Automated Data Collection:** seamless API integrations with wearable devices and health platforms.
- [ ] **Visual Dashboards:** Intuitive interfaces to track health trends over time.
- [ ] **AI-Driven Analysis:** Intelligent agents that identify patterns and anomalies in your health data.
- [ ] **Professional Access Portal:** A secure way for healthcare providers to view patient history (with explicit consent), improving diagnosis accuracy and care continuity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Anamnetic is built with modern, high-performance technologies to ensure scalability and security:

* **Backend:** [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for a robust and high-speed asynchronous API.
* **Frontend:** [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a reactive, lightning-fast user experience.
* **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for end-to-end type safety.
* **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for flexible, document-based health record storage.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Data privacy is at the core of Anamnetic. We are building the platform with security-first principles to ensure that sensitive health information remains under the user's control and is protected by industry-standard encryption and authentication protocols.

## 🏗 Project Status

This project is currently in **active development (MVP stage)** and is not yet available for public use.
